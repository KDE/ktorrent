The installation is pretty easy. You only need
kdelibs-dev installed. There is no build-time
dependency on KTorrent or libktorrent, as kio_magnet
ships its own repesentation of KTorrent's DBus 
interface. If it changes, you are screwed, but this
should not happen, as it is official and other programs
will rely on it as well.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

# in the source directory
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make -j2 # set 2 to the number of cores your cpu has
sudo make install

That's it.

Unsorted TODO list for future releases:

- Add cleanup functionality, so the user doesn't have to
cleanup himself in KTorrent. Maybe do this as a generic
plugin in KTorrent.
- Sort out the magnet schema details.
- Upstream the magnet link support as far as possible into
KTorrent.
- Add KDE integration to ease up file sharing: e.g. 
owncloud private tracker inclusion for easy private sharing,
KFile plugin to allow easy creation of Torrents, add a KCM/
KTorrent plugin to manger settings of kio_magnet.

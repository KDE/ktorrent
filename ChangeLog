Changes in 2.1beta1 
- WebGUI plugin added
- KTorrent can make trackerless torrents with DHT nodes.
- Added feature which saves the list of peers when a torrent is stopped and when it is started again, the list is reloaded and the peers are added to the list of potential peers so that we can quickly make connections to peers.

- Added 4 more default torrent groups (QM down/up, User down/up)
- Changed default groups to tree structure.
- Don't auto-dequeue torrents when not completed.

- Added grouping feature
- Switched to IDEAL style GUI (like KDevelop)

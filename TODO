TODO LIST :
-----------

If something is done put # in front of it.

1.2 :
-----
# 0) Rearrange stuff and do plugins

# 1) Switch to KNetwork classes (This could be frustrating)

2) Implement trackerless torrent like official client. (This will be big)

# 3) Immediatly store at final location

# 4) Implement this one : http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112080 and even go further (i.e. allow to resume partially downloaded stuff from other clients) (To avoid major code changes symlink cache directly to final file or dir) (3 and 4 are related and should be done together)

5) Make something similar like konquerer's change browser identification but then for KT's PeerID

# 6) Add option to paste URL to .torrent files

# 7) Implement IP blocking framework. Build our own (detect fake data and block
# peers) or use existing lists (e.g. openmedia.info). I had several peers (IP's
# were listed in blocking list from openmedia) and I was constantly having high
#dl rates from these clients but no actuall data was downloaded.

8) Make and show more statistics. (e.g. uptime, average transfer rates,
connected peers, etc...) (UI clutter needs to be avoided)

# 9) Implement temporary dir import (continue downloads)

# 10) When specific torrent has big chunks (512K or more) and KT starts
# downloading some of them, for example >5, it lasts *forever* to finish either
# one of them before you can start uploading those chunks and get higher
# download speeds (this can take a veeeery long time on slow connections).
# (This is against the BT protocol, i.e. you should not say you have stuff you do not have. It also requires big changes code wise, uploading happens directly from the file. But we should do something about these situations)

11) (maybe) Make customization of timer updates possible. This way the user can
specify update interval and transfer rates won't be so jumpy if the interval
has higher value... (We will see about this)

12) Split "Download" view into Download and Upload views. This way we separate
torrents we are leeching from the ones we are seeding.

13) Add option to allow the user to rename the top directory of multifile torrents

14) Implement queue manager

15) Add "Max d/u ratio" option (for seeding)

16) Add RSS plugin

# 17) Keep hammering tracker, it it can't be reached

18) Add properties dialog to show announce url

# 19) http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111260 (Initial tests show ktorrent handles this situation well)
# Close this bug !!!!!!!!!!!

20) letting the user configure columns in listview (maybe add share ratio column)

# 21) UPnP Plugin

22) Add scheduled download feature + allow KT to shutdown PC after a download is finished

2.0 :
-----
1) Switch to KDE 4 and Qt 4

 * the load and unload methods, any changes made in load must be undone in
 * unload.
 *
 * It's also absolutely forbidden to do any complex initialization in the constructor
 * (setting an int to 0 is ok, creating widgets isn't).
 * Only the name, author and description may be set in the constructor.
